	I am a third-year <strong>English major</strong> at <strong>Northeastern University</strong> with minors in <strong>Spanish, Writing, Communication Studies, & Global Fashion Studies</strong>. Based in Boston, I am an aspiring writer who champions individuality and thoughtful consumption through a deep understanding of self & style. 
	</p><p>Currently, I am a full-time Copywriter at <a href="https://www.ruelala.com/boutique/">Rue La La</a>. I also work part-time retail at <a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/">Anthropologie</a> on Newbury Street, and I am the Communications Associate for <a href="http://www.theavenuemag.com/">The Avenue Magazine</a>.
	</p><p>
	Previously, I was a Teaching Postdoctoral Fellow in English at the University of Toronto, affiliated with the new <a href="https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/">Data Sciences Institute</a>. I taught "The Digital Text," which explores the stakes and consequences of literatureâ€™s transition from printed to digital forms. I also supported a new class in development, "Literature and Data," an accessible introduction to data science in Python focused on textual analysis.
	</p><p>
	I served as a Program Assistant for the University of Toronto's <a href="https://dhn.utoronto.ca/">Digital Humanities Network</a>, and (with many others!) helped develop our new <a href="https://dhn.utoronto.ca/announcing-the-critical-digital-humanities-initiative/"> Critical Digital Humanities Initiative</a>, which supports anti-racist, feminist, queer, and decolonial digital scholarship.
	</p><p>
	With U of T's <a href="https://oldbooksnewscience.com/">Old Books New Science Lab</a>, I have coauthored research on <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000474/000474.html">emoji and affect in Slack</a> for <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>, and used <strong>3D video game software</strong> to model interactive medieval manuscripts for the <a href="http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/gillespie/content/welcome-book-fame">Book of Fame</a> speculative computing project.
	</p><p>
	As Co-Investigator with the University of Arkansas's <a href="http://text.csce.uark.edu/clip.html">Computational Literature Project (CLiP)</a>, I led a <strong>social network analysis</strong> of Shakespeare's plays.
	</p><p>
	As a hobby, I like to edit wikipedia to improve its coverage of historical women. I hand-coded this website myself so I could make it purple.
